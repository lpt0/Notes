/** Startup.cs
 * 
 * A lot of the code here is automatically generated by Visual Studio.
 * This file takes care of starting the server process and database 
 * connection(s). It also acts as a configuration file, to configure how
 * routing is handled by ASP.NET Core (such as automatically redirecting to
 * HTTPS, or serving static files).
 * The database connection string is also set up here. This is needed so that
 * Entity Framework Core can generate the controllers and views specified in
 * the context class - that library uses the connection string specified here
 * to connect to the database and set up the tables and relationships.
