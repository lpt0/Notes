    View a note by clicking on its name. Click on the username to be taken to a list with all of that user's notes, 
    or the group name to view all notes under that group.

    <!-- I have the create button at the top instead of at the end of the
         table, since there may be a lot of notes and I don't feel like 
         scrolling all the way down. 
         I'm not using an outline button here because I want the create 
         button to stick out, and so the user can easily find this -->
